UPGRADING
=========

Before you decide to update to the new release, note that 0.4.4.x is the last
branch that supports v2 onion address.

This means that v2 sites will be unavailable, but most important is that sites
such as pwndb will be unavailable.  We are using v2 in karma package.

The last stable branch that supports v2 onion address is 0.3.5.x.  This is a
good candidate for an upgrade.


PRECAUTION
==========

Make sure you edit /etc/pkgadd.conf and add the following lines:

	UPGRADE         ^var/lib/tor/.*$            NO
	UPGRADE         ^etc/tor/torrc$             NO
	UPGRADE         ^etc/tor/torifyrc$          NO

Failure to do so will result in the loss of your tor data and configuration
upon update!

If you edit the torrc file for extra logging, make sure you chmod'ed
/var/log/tor/* files for security reasons:

	sudo chmod 0640 /var/log/tor/*


PRE-INSTALL
===========

Tor expects to have a user and group dedicated to it.  "pre-install" script
takes care of this.


DNS NAMESERVER
==============

If you want to use Tor DNS as default nameserver on port 53, then don't forget
to allow non-root process to bind a privileged port:

	sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/bin/tor


End of file.
