OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains **stuff** pkgsrc collection: build scripts and
files for the packages that **do not** fit into the **core**,
**system**, **xorg** and **desktop** pkgsrc collections.

It wouldn't hurt to say that this collection packages are of very
low quality and this should be taken into account before using them.

This distribution was originally forked from CRUX ports as of version
3.6 and rewritten in POSIX sh(1p).
