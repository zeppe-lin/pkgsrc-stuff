OVERVIEW
========

This repository contains **stuff** pkgsrc collection: build scripts
and files for the packages that **do not** fit into the **core**,
**system**, **xorg** and **desktop** pkgsrc collections.

It wouldn't hurt to say that these collection packages are of very low
quality and this should be taken into account before using them.

This distribution was originally forked from CRUX ports as of version
3.6 and rewritten in POSIX sh(1p).

The original sources can be downloaded from:
