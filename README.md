OVERVIEW
--------
This directory contains stuff pkgsrc collection.  This collection
contains build scripts and files for the packages that **do not** fit
into the core, system, xorg and desktop pkgsrc collections.

This distribution was originally forked from CRUX ports as of version
3.6 and rewritten in POSIX sh(1p).  Also, the Zeppe-Lin has its own
criteria for what packages should be in stuff collection.
