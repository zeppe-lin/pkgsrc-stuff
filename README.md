OVERVIEW
========

This directory contains **stuff** pkgsrc collection: build scripts and files
for the packages that **do not** fit into the **core**, **system**, **xorg**
and **desktop** pkgsrc collections.

It wouldn't hurt to say that this collection packages are of very low quality
and this should be taken into account before using them.

This distribution was originally forked from CRUX ports as of version 3.6 and
rewritten in POSIX sh(1p).

The original sources can be downloaded from:
