PF_RING
=======

To get beyond 2 million packets/second, you need an Intel 10-gbps Ethernet
adapter and a special driver known as "PF_RING ZC" from ntop:
http://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/pf_ring-zc-zero-copy/

Masscan doesn't need to be rebuilt in order to use PF_RING.  To use PF_RING,
you need to build the following components:

	* libpfring.so  (installed in /usr/lib/libpfring.so)
	* pf_ring.ko    (their kernel driver)
	* ixgbe.ko      (their version of the Intel 10-gbps Ethernet driver)

You don't need to build their version of libpcap.so.

When Masscan detects that an adapter is named something like zc:enp1s0 instead
of something like enp1s0, it'll automatically switch to PF_RING ZC mode.
