README torsocks


REQUIREMENTS
============

We do not depend on tor which might be running on a different box.  But if we
do not have running tor instance on a different box, then we must install it.


PRECAUTION
==========

If you have added some specific settings to /etc/tor/torsocks.conf and want to
prevent the loss of your data upon update, make sure you edited
/etc/pkgadd.conf and added the following line:

	UPGRADE    ^etc/tor/torsocks.conf$    NO


End of file.
