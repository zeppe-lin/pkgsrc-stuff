BUGS

	Java applications which use the XToolkit/XAWT backend may draw grey
	windows only.  The XToolkit/XAWT backend breaks ICCCM-compliance in
	recent JDK 1.5 and early JDK 1.6 versions, because it assumes a
	reparenting window manager.  Possible workarounds are using JDK 1.4
	(which doesn't contain the XToolkit/XAWT backend) or setting the
	environment variable AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit (to use the older Motif
	backend instead) or running ``xprop -root -f _NET_WM_NAME 32a -set
	_NET_WM_NAME LG3D'' or ``wmname LG3D'' (to pretend that a
	non-reparenting window manager is running that the XToolkit/XAWT
	backend can recognize) or when using OpenJDK setting the environment
	variable _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1.

FONT SETTINGS

	There is a system property to set anti-aliasing.  To do this
	system-wide, add the following line to /etc/profile:

		export _JAVA_OPTIONS="-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on \
		-Dswing.aatext=true"

	And set "off/false" if you're using anti-aliased font, like Terminus.

	Some Java applications may specify use of a particular TrueType font;
	these applications must be made aware of the directory path to the
	desired font.  TrueType fonts are installed in the directory
	/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF.  Add the following line to /etc/profile to
	enable these fonts.

		export JAVA_FONTS=/usr/share/fonts/X11/TTF

GTK THEME

	To use GTK look and feel, add the following line to /etc/profile:

		export _JAVA_OPTIONS="$_JAVA_OPTIONS \
		-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel \
		-Dswing.crossplatformlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel"
